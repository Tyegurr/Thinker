# Tinker

**A plethora of editor changes, additions, and improvements to make editing levels feel just a little bit better.** 

This mod provides a fully customizable and modular feature set for you to use the editor how you want to!

**Don't like a feature?** 

Well you can toggle anything you want on and off. All disabled features are **fully** disabled, meaning they won't be hiding in the background affecting performance without you realizing.

**<cy>This is a beta!**

Expect bugs, incompatibilities with other mods, etc. Please report any problems on the mod's [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Alphalaneous/Tinker/issues) page. 

Some features here can affect the load time of the Editor. Do note that improvements are planned and actively being looked into.
